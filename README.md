# Monsjé98

This project was created solely for demonstrative purposes to showcase my front-end development skills. It was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) with the template generated by [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). The site represents an e-commerce store for the imagined natural cosmetics brand Monsjé98 – an exclusive brand where all graphics are custom mockups prepared by me (downloaded from Envato). I put a great deal of effort into every detail to achieve a unique and professional design.

**Disclaimer:**  
This project was created as a portfolio piece. You are welcome to use it as inspiration for design and development, but copying the project in its entirety or using it to create a website that purports to be associated with the Monsjé98 brand is prohibited.
